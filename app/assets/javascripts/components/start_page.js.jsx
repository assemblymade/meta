                          Assembly collects a 10% platform fee of the revenue after expenses. This is initially used to cover basic operating costs until a product’s revenue exceeds costs. Any proceeds after expenses are distributed to coin holders based on their app coins percentages. You can see <a href="https://assembly.com/coderwall/financials">Coderwall</a> as an example of a mature product paying out in this model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We care deeply that we’re creating more value for the community than the 10% collected as a platform fee. Building on Assembly not only connects you with others around the world, but you also can build products with the freedom of not having to hand initial capital to run the product, managing the finances, paying accounting and legal costs and all the other burdens of operating a traditional company. We’re also investing in continuing to find ways to create new value for the community as well as exploring ways to reduce fees if feasible.

                        <p>Generally no. Assembly is not an incubator. We’re focused on enabling the distributed Assembly community to both build and continue to grow successful products. An important part of this is that anyone can come help build any product, with full trust that their work (if accepted) will be rewarded with an ownership stake in that product that will translate to a portion of any future revenue.</p>
                        <p>In order for Assembly to ensure that the community’s work is rewarded in perpetuity, products being built on Assembly need to stay on Assembly. An exception to this is if the partners agreed to sell the product to an acquiring company.</p>

                        <p>You are always free to keep building and keep trying on Assembly – so there’s no point at which you could no longer keep trying. If nobody earns App Coins in your product, you are free to take it elsewhere, but once people have earned ownership in your product, it has to live on in the Assembly community.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, products sat for months with little interest before suddenly picking up momentum in the community. Your product could follow that trajectory.</p>

                        <p>Yes. If a third-party offers to acquire an Assembly product and the partners (everyone with ownership stake) decide it is the right decision for the community, the customers and the product, then a product can be sold.</p>
                        <p>When a product is sold, earnings are treated like any other revenue and are paid out to the community.</p>

                        <p>We deliberately leave the roadmap up to each product’s Core Team. We urge and help products to outline clear ways to monetizing the product. You’ll find most products have these roadmaps in their discussions or plainly stated on their product pages.
