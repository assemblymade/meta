                <p>Hi <%= @user.username %>,</p>

                <p>I saw you joined the <a href="<%= product_people_url(@product, auth_token: @user.authentication_token) %>"><%= @product.name %> team</a>, but haven't tackled a bounty yet. Anybody can get involved with a product but I understand that it can be difficult to get that first bounty.</p>

                <p>Here are some tips that have helped other people like yourself:
                  <ol>
                    <li><a href="<%= product_chat_url(@product, auth_token: @user.authentication_token) %>">Jump into chat</a> and talk to the core team. They're generally the best people to help you get setup, they know they project inside and out, and always appreciate a helping hand.</li>
                    <li>Read the <a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub Guides</a>. If you're not familiar with GitHub they're the best place to get started.</li>
                    <li>Join me and the other Assembly staff members in the Assembly <a href="<%= product_chat_url(:meta, auth_token: @user.authentication_token)%>">Meta Chat</a>. We may not know the details of a product, but more often than not can use our experience to tackle and issues you're having.
If you had any other questions, feel free to ask me personally and I'll do my best to help out.</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <p>Cheers,</p>

                <p>Austin</p>
