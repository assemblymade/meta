# How can I get to know other Assembly community members?

The best way to do this is to become an active member. Introduce yourself to the team working on a project you like, and see how you can help. Collaboration is what makes Assembly special, and you’ll start to see that as soon as you start working side-by-side with great people.

Pro-tip Assembly supports both [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and Emoji site wide.


# Where should I communicate with people on Assembly?

There are different places to communicate on Assembly, and each serves a different purpose


# Chat

Each product has a chat room, which can be found at assembly.com/PRODUCT-NAME/chat. This is an all-purpose forum for discussion.


# Bounties

If you want to talk about a specific bounty, the comments  section underneath it is the best place to do this.


# Discussions

Discussions are like open-ended bounties. If you want to talk through something, but there isn’t specific work or an intended resolution, then you can start a discussion.


# Meta Chat

[Assembly Meta Chat](http://assembly.com/meta/chat) is where our team hangs out. If you have questions for us, or would just like to say hello, feel free to drop in there.


# How can I change my avatar?

Assembly uses [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) for avatars. Head over there, create an account with the email address you used to sign up for Assembly, and add an avatar. It should start appearing on Assembly moments later.


# How can I call attention or assign a bounty to someone?

The best way to do this is to @mention the person's username in the comments below a bounty.


# How can I reward someone for doing something awesome?

Tip them! You'll notice a small "tip" button above comments, click it and it will send an App Coin over to the person who wrote it.
