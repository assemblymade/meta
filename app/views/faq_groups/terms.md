# App Coins

App Coins represent ownership of an Assembly product. Each product has its own set of coins, and each coin holds a certain percentage of ownership. App Coins can be earned by contributing to a project, and can also be “tipped” between users.


# Core Team

Every Assembly app also has a Core Team of active, key contributors. The Core Team influences the vision of the app, standards for quality, and evaluates which contributions are accepted. [Learn more about the roles and responsibilities of a Core Team](https://assembly.com/core-team).


# Contributor

A contributor is anyone who helps build a product.


# Project

A project is a place within a product to group bounties, discuss priorities and track overall progress.


# Bounty/WIP

A bounty is a bit of work that needs to be done on a product. It could be code, design or copy. Each bounty has a number of App Coins assigned to it, which are awarded to the contributor who completes it.


# Meta

Meta is the Assembly product itself. We are building our company on Assembly, so if you are curious about our progress and our roadmap, visit us in Meta anytime.


# Staff Picks

Staff Picks are products the Assembly team is excited about. These products are featured on the Discover page.


# Tip Contract

An agreed percentage of new App Coins that go to the Core Team and/or the author of a given bounty. Typically, the Core Team receives 5% of any newly awarded coins, and the bounty author receives 5%.
