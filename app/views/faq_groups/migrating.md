# I have an existing product, can I put it on Assembly?

Yes. You can take any product you've already started building, launched, or is even profitable to Assembly

# How do prepare my existing product for Assembly?

Assembly manages all domains in escrow on behalf of the contributors and core team. Additionally collects the revenue and distributes proceeds to all the contributors. Before an existing product can be built on Assembly, its important that the code base is released under the AGPL license and the domain and revenue collection is transferred for management to Assembly.

# If another company wants to acquire my product, will that be possible?

Yes. If a company is interested and your team decides it's the right next step, then your product can be acquired. Acquisition earnings would be treated like any other revenue and distributed to everyone who owns that product's App Coins.

# Am I giving up control of my product by putting it on Assembly?

No. You will be the only member of the Core Team to start. This means you make all decisions regarding quality control, vision, and which contributions get merged into the product. Over time, you are welcome to add people to the Core Team if/when it makes sense to you. (We can also help you navigate these decisions, don't hesitate to reach out)

# I already have a repo with code, what do I do?

Assembly provides a free public GitHub repo for every product. If you already have source code elsewhere, push it up to the GitHub repo Assembly has provisioned for your product. You'll also need to update the license to AGPL.

# Can I "fire" somoene from my product team?

Not exactly. A person's contributions can be rejected, and they can be booted off of the Core Team by 3/4 majority vote. Since you won't be "hiring" the people you are working with per se, you can't really "fire" them either.

# How do I prepare my existing closed source code base for open sourcing?

Before allowing everyone to read your source code, do a quick check for any glaring vulnerabilities. Getting setup on [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) can also help identify potential security issues and show you which messy parts of your app need some refactoring. You'll also want to remove any private information from your repo (that includes anything in the entire git history). Moving configuration related passwords and keys outside of the repo and then squahsing all of the previous history is a good start.

# How do I transfer my domain?

[Contact us](mailto:support@assembly.com) and we'll help you get started. Assembly will release your domain back to the original owner at anytime requested prior to accepting contributions from Assembly contributors. If a product has accepted contributions from the Assembly community then reclaiming the domain requires unanimous consent from the Core Team, Assembly and a notice to the community with proper time for feedback.

# What do I do about hosting my new product?

Continue to host the product in the same way your used to. Report any monthly expenses to your product's financials so the community can reimburse those costs from the future profit.
