title: Who is in control?
---

You are. Assembly apps are built by everyone, but like successful open source products every Assembly app also has a [Core Team](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fassemblymade.com%2Fcore-team&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH5QB9F3K1XC3Zd9q1vmNFoedsotA) of active, key contributors. The Core Team influences the vision of the app, standards for quality, and evaluates which contributions are accepted.


A new app's Core Team is typically made up of the inventor and Assembly staff members. As development progresses, more contributors would comprise the core team, and Assembly staff members will typically only provide support services as needed.

---
title: How are the apps licensed?
---

Each Assembly app's source code is released under a BSD 3-clause license, making it freely available for non-commercial use and development.


However, Assembly retains an exclusive license to commercialize the app so we can award the proceeds back to the people who made it. The Assembly platform is intended to make it easy to view and search all discussions, comments, designs, and other contributions to a project. Assembly transparently shares an app's revenue, costs, and anonymized data including number of users, MAU, page views, and other key metrics.

---
title: What technology is used to build Assembly apps?
---

An Assembly app's core technology is decided by the Core Team and early contributors when development is first started. We host components on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) when possible for the time being. This guarantees the code the community builds will have a [level of modularity](http://12factor.net/).


As other technologies like [docker](http://www.docker.io/) and [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) evolve so may our stack.

title: What if I find work that is clearly needed, but doesn’t have a task assigned to it?
---

Hop into that product’s chat room, and let someone know! If the need exists, the core team can create a task and let you run with it. Once you complete it, you’ll be rewarded with App Coins.

---
title: What happens when there are disagreements?
---

The Assembly platform is intended to allow everyone to participate in influencing the direction of an app. Assembly also actively surfaces key metrics so all decisions are data driven and can even be reevaluated and rolled back later when more data is available. In the event the community hasn't come to a clear direction and the data is inconclusive, the core team will be left to mediate disputes and decide on an outcome.

---
title: What if work needs to get done that nobody is doing?
---

If a necessary task goes uncompleted, Assembly may be able to help. We're equipped to handle design, accounting, legal issues, PR, marketing and more. We also may cover the initial infrastructure and marketing costs, at our discretion. As an app begins earning revenue, we pay those costs from the profits and distribute the remaining proceeds back to the contributors. Every app has an Assembly employee assigned as its liaison.

---
title: What happens if development stops on an app?
---

If an idea doesn't get and/or sustain support Assembly may decide to retire it. We'll notify the inventor and all the contributors. Assembly will also change the source code license to the MIT license and all non-code contributed work will be released under the [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial 3.0 Unported License](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc%2F3.0%2Fus%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGD0KjEha9wLevv3yo3xo6SQsKLXw).
