title: What does it mean to watch a product?
---

If you are watching a product, you’ll receive notifications (both on the web and occasionally via email) when people are discussing the product or creating new bounties and projects on it.

---
title: Can I create a bounty for a product if I’m not on the Core Team?
---

Yes. If you haven’t worked on the product much, it may be best to check in with the Core Team in chat and make sure priorities are aligned, but anyone can create a bounty.

---
title: How do I convey priority for a bounty?
---

Upvote it. Each upvote increases the number of App Coins assigned to a bounty, and also increases its visibility on the bounty list. If you are on the Core Team for a product, you can also adjust the priority tag for a bounty.

title: Where can I request features for Assembly?
