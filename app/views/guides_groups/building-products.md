#### Assembly Payments / Stripe

Assembly has built a proxy through Stripe that allows your product to collect
revenue from customers. Using Assembly payments makes it easy for Assembly to
distribute revenue to you and contributors on your product. Assembly will issue
US citizens a 1099 if their share of the revenue exceeds a certain threshold as
specified by the IRS.

Check out the [Assembly payments
repo](https://github.com/asm-products/payments) and README for instructions on
how to integrate Assembly payments with your app.
