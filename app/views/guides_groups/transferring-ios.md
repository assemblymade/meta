# Transferring An Existing iOS App
#### App Ownership
To move your product onto Assembly, you will need to transfer ownership so that we can track revenue, expenses, and disburse profits to you and your contributors.

#### Transferring your app with iTunes Connect

4. Send an email to assembly@helpful.io with your app name and the github repository for your product.

#### Source code
Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Your product repo will be located at `github.com/asm-products/PRODUCTSLUG`. Please push the source code for your app to this repository. Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if you have problems accessing your repository.


#### Domains
Assembly holds domains on behalf of the respective products to which they belong. All products on Assembly must transfer ownership of their domains within 90 days of joining the platform. Products that have not transfered their domains within this time frame will be removed from the platform.

If you already own a domain that you would like to use with your Assembly product, unlock your domain at your registrar and email assembly@helpful.io with an authorization code to initialize the transfer.

If you do not have a domain and would like to purchase one, email assembly@helpful.io. Include the name of your Assembly product, the desired domain name, and a link to the Github repository for your product.
