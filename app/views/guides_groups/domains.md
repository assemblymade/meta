# Hosting

#### What hosting provider should I use?

Assembly can often cover paid hosting costs for products that use Heroku.
To get started with this process, email support@assembly.com to transfer
ownership of your Heroku app.  You are free to use other platforms, such as
AWS, DigitalOcean, Google App Engine, or others. However, we do not yet support
paying for these providers.

# Domains

#### Purchasing new domains

Assembly can purchase a domain on behalf of products. Email assembly@helpful.io
if you have selected an available name for purchase.

#### Transferring existing domains

If you already own a domain that you would like to use with your Assembly
product, unlock your domain at your registrar and email assembly@helpful.io
with an authorization code to initialize the transfer.

#### Domain ownership

Assembly holds domains on behalf of the respective products to which they
belong. All products on Assembly must transfer ownership of their domains
within 90 days of joining the platform. Products that have not transfered their
domains within this timeframe will be removed from the platform.

# Version Control

#### Github repositories

Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products
organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Any users on your product's
Core Team will have write access as long as their Github account is linked on
Assembly.

#### Adding or removing contributors

Please email support@assembly.com if you need to grant write access to non-core
users or remove write access.
